# Pipes

Pipes are the way to chain functions to transform a value. Vento uses the
[pipeline operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator), `|>`.

Note: this is not exactly like the last proposal for JavaScript, it's inspired
by
[the previous proposal](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines)
that was rejected but it's way more simple and fits better for filters.

Pipes can be used to [print a variable](./1.print.md), [save it](./3.set.md) or
[before iterating a collection](./4.for.md#pipes).

Pipes can run three types of functions, in this order of priority:

## Filters

Filters are custom functions that you can configure to transform variables. By
default Vento has the `escape`, `unescape` and `safe` filters out of the box, to
escape and unescape HTML code:

```vto
{{ "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>" |> escape }}
```

The `safe` filter does not transform the content, but can be used to mark HTML
data as trusted when in autoescaping mode;

```vto
{{ myTrustedSource.getHtml() |> safe }}
```

If the filter accepts additional arguments you can pass them between
parenthesis:

```vto
{{ "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>" |> filter_name(arg1, arg2, ...) }}
```

## Global functions

Vento will execute functions available in the standard JavaScript namespace,
such as `JSON.stringify()`:

```vto
{{ { name: "Óscar", surname: "Otero" } |> JSON.stringify }}
```

This is equivalent to:

```vto
{{ JSON.stringify({ name: "Óscar", surname: "Otero" }) }}
```

The value is passed as the first argument. Any other argument will go in the
next positions:

```vto
{{ { name: "Óscar", surname: "Otero" } |> JSON.stringify(null, 2) }}
```

This is equivalent to:

```vto
{{ JSON.stringify({ name: "Óscar", surname: "Otero" }, null, 2) }}
```

## Prototype functions

As a fallback, Vento will execute the function as a prototype of the variable.
In this example, the variable is a string that has the
[`toUpperCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
method, so it can be passed as a Pipe:

```vto
{{ "Hello, world!" |> toUpperCase }}
```

This is equivalent to:

```vto
{{ "Hello, world!".toUpperCase() }}
```

## Chain pipes

You can chain different functions with the pipe operator and use `await` for
async functions. For example:

```vto
{{
  "https://example.com/data.json"
  |> await fetch
  |> await json
  |> JSON.stringify
}}
```

- [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) is a global
  async function.
- [`json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json) is an
  async method of the `Response` object returned by `fetch`.
- [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
  is a global function.

The JavaScript equivalent of this is:

```js
JSON.stringify(await (await fetch("https://example.com/data.json")).json());
```
