# Include

Use `{{ include [filename] }}` to insert other templates in place. Vento will
look for the included file in the
[`includes` folder](../2.configuration.md#includes).

```vto
{{ include "filename.vto" }}
```

Use relative paths to include files relative to the current template:

```vto
{{ include "./filename.vto" }}
```

The file name can be any JavaScript expression, useful if you want to include
files dynamically:

```vto
{{ include `${name}.vto` }}
```

## Data

The included file inherits the same data as the main file. But you can add
additional data by passing an object after the file name.

```vto
{{ include "./filename.vto" { name: "Ã“scar" } }}
```

## Pipes

You can use [pipes](./2.pipes.md) to transform the included content. For
example:

```vto
{{ include "/hello-world.vto" |> toUpperCase }}
```

This code outputs:

```
HELLO WORLD
```
