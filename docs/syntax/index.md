# Syntax

The API of Vento is designed to be very simple but flexible.

In addition to the typical tags that you can find in other template engines for
common stuff like conditions, loops, include partials... you can write real
JavaScript code that will be executed on runtime.

This opens the door to an endless of possibilities and makes the engine very
powerful without the need to learn a new syntax, making Vento a very
easy-to-learn template engine, especially for people familiar with JavaScript.
